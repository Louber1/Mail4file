# Mail4file
Short script, that sends you an email everytime a new file gets into your folder and put it as attachment into the mail!
It should work with every file extension (.mp4, .mp3, .pdf ...)

You can use this script as you want, and also reuse it in your projects.
But please give the credits to me, thanks!
