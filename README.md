# Mail4file
Short script, that sends you an email everytime a new file gets into your folder!#
It should work with every file extension (.mp4, .mp3, .pdf ...)

You can use this script as you want, and also reuse it in your projects.
But please give the credits to me, thanks!

HOW TO USE:

1. pip install watchdog

2. cd Mail4file

3. edit the file (put in your email accounts and so on)

3. python3 Emailscript.py

4. wait for a new file and receive the email!
